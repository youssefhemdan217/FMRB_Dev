# 🎉 Backend Setup Complete!

Your FMRB Backend is now fully set up with MySQL integration!

## ✅ What I Built For You

### 1. **Backend Structure**
```
app/backend/
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── database.ts          # MySQL connection & query helper
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── room.controller.ts   # Room CRUD with SQL
│   │   └── booking.controller.ts # Booking CRUD with overlap detection
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── room.routes.ts
│   │   └── booking.routes.ts
│   ├── types/
│   │   ├── room.types.ts        # ✅ Matches frontend exactly
│   │   └── booking.types.ts     # ✅ Matches frontend exactly
│   ├── middleware/
│   │   └── error.middleware.ts
│   └── index.ts                 # Server entry point
│
├── database/
│   ├── schema.sql               # Database structure (with learning comments!)
│   └── seed.sql                 # Sample data for testing
│
├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md         # Complete API reference
├── MYSQL_SETUP.md              # Step-by-step MySQL setup guide
├── README.md                    # Updated with MySQL info
├── package.json                 # Added mysql2 dependency
├── .env                         # MySQL configuration
└── .env.example                 # Template with MySQL settings
```

### 2. **Type Compatibility**
✅ Fixed all type mismatches between frontend and backend:
- `Room.location` instead of `floor` & `building`
- `Room.isActive` instead of `status`
- `Room.workHours` with `start` and `end`
- `Booking.start` and `Booking.end` instead of `startTime` and `endTime`
- Removed extra fields not needed by frontend

### 3. **MySQL Database**

#### Tables Created:
1. **`rooms`** table
   - Stores all meeting rooms
   - JSON support for amenities array
   - Auto-incrementing ID
   - Timestamps for created/updated

2. **`bookings`** table
   - Stores all room bookings
   - Foreign key to rooms (with CASCADE delete)
   - Automatic overlap detection
   - Indexed for fast queries

#### Sample Data:
- 6 sample rooms with different capacities
- 6 sample bookings (today + tomorrow)

### 4. **Educational Comments**

I added **tons of comments** throughout the code to help you learn:
- Every SQL query explained
- Why we use `?` placeholders (SQL injection prevention)
- How Foreign Keys work
- How to prevent booking overlaps
- Comparison to MongoDB where relevant

### 5. **Complete Documentation**

- **`API_DOCUMENTATION.md`**: Every endpoint with examples
- **`MYSQL_SETUP.md`**: Step-by-step MySQL setup (perfect for beginners!)
- **`database/schema.sql`**: Heavily commented SQL schema
- **`database/seed.sql`**: Sample data with explanations

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Set Up MySQL

1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Connect to your local MySQL server
3. Open and run: `app/backend/database/schema.sql`
4. (Optional) Run: `app/backend/database/seed.sql`

**Detailed instructions:** See `app/backend/MYSQL_SETUP.md`

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Edit `app/backend/.env`:
```env
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password_here  👈 Change this!
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

From the **root directory**:
```bash
npm install
```

This installs the `mysql2` package and all other dependencies.

### Step 4: Start Backend

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ MySQL Connected Successfully!
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000
📡 API endpoints available at http://localhost:3000/api/v1
💾 Database: fmrb_db on localhost
```

### Step 5: Test It!

Open your browser or use cURL:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Get all rooms
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/rooms

# Get all bookings
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/bookings
```

## 📚 Learning Path

Since you're learning MySQL, here's how I structured everything:

### 1. **Start with Schema**
Read `app/backend/database/schema.sql`
- See how tables are created
- Understand PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY
- Learn about indexes

### 2. **Run Sample Queries**
Read `app/backend/database/seed.sql`
- See INSERT, SELECT statements
- Understand JOINs
- Practice in MySQL Workbench

### 3. **Study Controllers**
Read the controller files:
- `room.controller.ts` - Basic CRUD operations
- `booking.controller.ts` - Complex queries (overlap detection)
- Every query has comments explaining what it does

### 4. **Compare to MongoDB**
I added comments comparing MySQL to MongoDB so you can see:
- `SELECT * FROM rooms` ≈ `db.rooms.find()`
- `INSERT INTO` ≈ `db.collection.insertOne()`
- Foreign Keys ≈ References (but automatic!)

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts You'll Learn

### 1. **SQL Queries**
```sql
-- SELECT: Get data
SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE capacity > 10;

-- INSERT: Add data
INSERT INTO rooms (name, capacity) VALUES ('Room A', 10);

-- UPDATE: Modify data
UPDATE rooms SET capacity = 12 WHERE id = 1;

-- DELETE: Remove data
DELETE FROM rooms WHERE id = 1;
```

### 2. **Foreign Keys**
Unlike MongoDB where you just store an ID, MySQL enforces relationships:
```sql
room_id INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES rooms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```
This means: "room_id MUST exist in rooms table, and if a room is deleted, delete its bookings too!"

### 3. **Preventing SQL Injection**
❌ **BAD** (dangerous!):
```javascript
query(`SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE id = ${id}`)  // Can be hacked!
```

✅ **GOOD** (safe):
```javascript
query('SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE id = ?', [id])  // Secure!
```

### 4. **Overlap Detection**
Complex logic to prevent double-booking:
```sql
WHERE room_id = ? 
AND start < ? 
AND end > ?
```

## 💡 Tips for Learning

1. **Use MySQL Workbench** to run queries manually and see results
2. **Read the comments** in every file - they're there to teach you!
3. **Experiment** - try modifying queries, see what happens
4. **Compare** - look at MongoDB vs MySQL side-by-side
5. **Ask questions** - if something doesn't make sense, ask!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to MySQL?
1. Check MySQL service is running (Windows Services)
2. Verify password in `.env` file
3. Make sure you ran `schema.sql`

### Frontend not connecting to backend?
1. Check backend is running on port 3000
2. Check `app/frontend/.env` has correct API URL
3. Check CORS is enabled (it is by default)

### Booking overlap not working?
1. Check your dates are in ISO 8601 format
2. Look at the SQL query in `booking.controller.ts`
3. Test manually in MySQL Workbench
