# 🔐 JWT Secrets Configuration - FIXED

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The error `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET: Required` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET: Required` has been **FIXED**.

---

## 🔑 **Generated Secure JWT Secrets**

Your application now has properly generated JWT secrets that meet the requirements:

```env
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=5d45875fc4eada856bcc4044aa4edd8434282ea28b89e1889c07535aede44e10
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=5c2cebda93c331fc339a155ecfb12d93c0a55c06d2d21bd755fc092cb5b4ce5c
```

**✅ Each secret is 64 characters long** (exceeds the 32-character minimum requirement)  
**✅ Generated using cryptographically secure random bytes**  
**✅ Already updated in your deployment package**

---

## 📁 **Where to Use These Secrets**

### **For Current Deployment:**
**✅ ALREADY DONE** - The secrets are already in your deployment package:
- **File Location:** `deployment-package/.env`
- **Status:** Ready to deploy

### **For Server Deployment:**
1. **Copy the updated deployment package** to your server
2. **Extract to:** `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\MeetingBookingApi\` (or your application directory)
3. **The .env file is already configured** with the proper secrets
4. **Restart your IIS application**

---

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix**

After updating the `.env` file on your server, your application should start without the JWT secret errors.

**Expected result:**
- ❌ ~~JWT_ACCESS_SECRET: Required~~
- ❌ ~~JWT_REFRESH_SECRET: Required~~
- ✅ **Application starts successfully**

---

## 🔄 **For Future Deployments**

If you need to generate new secrets later, use the included script:
```cmd
generate-jwt-secrets.bat
```

This will create new secure secrets that you can copy to your `.env` file.

## 📦 **Updated Deployment Package**

**New File:** `FMRB-API-Deployment-Package-FIXED.zip`

This package contains:
- ✅ **Fixed .env file** with proper JWT secrets
- ✅ **All application files**
- ✅ **JWT secrets generator script**
- ✅ **Deployment troubleshooting tools**

---

## 🔐 **Security Notes**

- **Keep these secrets secure** - never share them publicly
- **Backup these secrets** - store them in a secure location
- **Rotate periodically** - generate new secrets every few months for security
- **Different environments** - use different secrets for development/production

**Your JWT secret error is now FIXED!** 🎉
